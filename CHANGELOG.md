# 1.0.6-legacy+1.18
_This is a "one-shot" legacy version_

It should work for 1.18 and 1.19.

_⚠️ WARNING_: 1.18 has a critical bug in the pathfinding code: Small entities track the invalid pathnode (next one/one ahead) that they try to reach. This was fixed in 1.19.

Why 1.18?
1.18 and above support Java 17 which is (currently) the minimum version for the tools that are used to build the mod.
